# Flipkart--A Letter to Shareholders
Dear Shareholders

Since 2007, the journey of Flipkart as India’s first major online retailer has been truly rewarding. Under the leadership of our esteemed Executives the company has grown multifold in terms of revenue and product categories. From starting off as an online book seller to handling 10 million page visits per day, Flipkart’s development as an e-retailer is proven. Flipkart has over 16,000 full time employees all over the country. With the recent record-high monthly shipments of 8 million, we are now leading the Indian e-commerce market. With some great achievements like these, we would like to proudly announce that now, we are targeting to achieve a revenue growth rate of 10% in FY 22. As much as it seems ambitious, we think it is not impossible for us if we channel our focus towards:
•	increasing our product categories from <100 to 165+,
•	improving the number of assured sellers on the platform,
•	decrease the number of monthly complaints,
•	target 25 million Flipkart Plus users.
Some of our current subsidiaries like PhonePe, Myntra, Mallers, etc. are doing extremely well and we are also planning on expanding our portfolio by acquiring ‘Sasta Sundar’, a digital health platform. With the recent pandemic, the global potential for e-pharmaceuticals has taken a complete turnover. In the upcoming year, Flipkart will most positively also enter the digital health sector, considering our added advantage of technological backup and e-market expertise to procure and ship the medicines.

We are planning on introducing 170 different product categories under our private labels in fashion, furniture, consumer durables and large appliances. As an organization with a current valuation at $37.7 billion USD, we have always prioritized on making our esteemed shareholders profitable. Even though Walmart owns the magnitude of the shares, we have always kept our minor shareholders in mind. With diligence and constant efforts, we would like to increase the profits of our investors consistently. We are also making efforts to improve our organizations overall sustainability by helping our sellers reduce their waste and inventory damages. We would like to improve our-
•	inventory management [ to reduce overall carbon footprint],
•	website interface [to lessen the mistakes of wrong deliveries and unwanted product suggestions],
•	returns-handling protocol [to avoid damage of goods while re-shipment form customer to seller].
We would like to remain the Indian market leaders in the upcoming years too. We are the first home-based app to reach 50 million downloads in play store and have a great following in all social media platforms. We would like to continue showing our best to our customers and value their satisfaction as our priority. With arduous targets to be achieved in the upcoming quarters, we are all busy communicating, analyzing, and delivering every day. With thorough preparations, we are also planning on entering the international market in a bigger scale by 2023. We hope that our journey inspires many other budding businesses. We hope you [ our shareholders/investors] stay with us and develop together for a long time.


TEAM FLIPKART
